# WorkBuddy Manager

**Management console for Tencent CodeBuddy account pools · OpenAI-compatible gateway**

A web console for [`workbuddy2api`](https://github.com/Sliverkiss/workbuddy2api):
bulk QR onboarding, scheduled check-in and token keep-alive, per-group API key
distribution, IP and model allowlists, request logs and usage analytics; installs and
updates come from a signed release package.

> The upstream workbuddy2api source **ships inside this project's release package**
> (MIT). Existing deployments are unaffected — for reinstall/migration, see the
> [deployment guide](deploy/README.md#〇上游源码从哪来随发布包分发).

## What is this

`workbuddy2api` (its original repository has been deleted by its author) wraps a Tencent CodeBuddy
account pool into an OpenAI-compatible API (written in Go). Its capabilities are complete,
but they are command-line only: adding an account means running a script, checking status
means `curl /status`, and handing out API keys has no interface at all.

This project fills that gap — a web console you can safely run on the public internet:

| What you used to do | What you do now |
|---|---|
| Run `login.sh` on the server to scan a QR code | Click "Add account", scan, and it is checked in and managed automatically |
| `curl /status` to see which account is down | Dashboard shows health, cooldown and token expiry in real time |
| Hand-edit `config.json` for check-in / concurrency | Visual settings with toggles and number inputs |
| Every downstream client shares one global key | Issue multiple keys, each with its own quota, IP and model allowlist |
| No idea who consumed how much | Every call is logged: model, tokens, latency, source IP |
| No IP protection at all | Inbound allow/deny lists plus per-key IP limits and allowlists |

> **Not a single line of workbuddy2api is modified.** Account rotation, concurrency and
> circuit breaking stay its job; this project is a separate console and gateway.

**How this relates to workbuddy2api**: this project is the **visual companion** to it —
it makes a capable upstream gateway visible and manageable. The two fit together naturally:

- **The upstream provides the capabilities, the panel presents them**: account scheduling,
  token refresh and circuit breaking are workbuddy2api's job; the panel visualises those
  capabilities and adds the operational side — key distribution, IP control, usage stats
- **We learn from each other and evolve together**: when the upstream gains a capability
  this project follows, and operational needs discovered on the panel side feed back to the
  upstream. The upstream lists this project among its "community front-end panels", and we
  hope to make that ecosystem better together
- **The upstream stays focused on its core**: the panel does not ask the upstream to change
  code for it, so the upstream can stay lean

Contributions are welcome: both panel and upstream-source issues and ideas belong in
[this repository](https://github.com/ithtelab/workbuddy-manager/issues) — the original
upstream repo is gone, and its source is now maintained here.

## Highlights

### Accounts

- **QR onboarding** — WeChat / QQ scan-to-authorize, then daily check-in, auth file write and upstream reload
- **Token monitoring** — expiry bars with warnings, one-click renewal, connectivity probe, manual check-in
- **Account groups** — several pools side by side; lists, check-in and keys stay per-group
- **Credits & expiry** — live balance, graded colouring, countdown for soon-to-expire credits
- **Task history** — check-in / travel / activity / keep-alive results and credit flow, paged

### Gateway (`/v1`)

- **OpenAI compatible** — standard SDKs connect directly; streaming and non-streaming
- **Key distribution** — per-key realm, expiry, IP count, IP / model allowlists and quota
- **Model aliases** — map the names your downstream uses onto the real models
- **Model centre** — every usable model on one page: context, max output, thinking tiers
- **Full audit trail** — key, IP, model, status, TTFB, billing and cache hits per call

### Visual settings

- **Scheduled tasks** — check-in / travel / activity / keep-alive, each with its own switch and time
- **Multiple upstreams** — configure several instances, each with its own address and `api_key`
- **Security** — inbound IP allow / deny lists (CIDR), audit log, separate session and API tokens
- **Updates & backup** — one-click update (signature-checked), off-site PostgreSQL backup
- **Five locales** — Simplified / Traditional Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean

The exhaustive list (with detail per item) lives in [the full feature list](docs/features.md).

## Quick start

You need a server that can run Docker (1 vCPU / 1 GB is enough). Pick one:

**① Docker (run the container yourself)**

```bash
docker run -d --name workbuddy-manager -p 7864:7864 -v /opt/workbuddy-manager/data:/app/data ghcr.io/ithtelab/workbuddy-manager:latest
```

**② One-shot installer (dependencies, package, systemd)**

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ithtelab/workbuddy-manager/main/deploy/install.sh)
```

Then open `http://<your-server>:7864`; the initial admin password is printed in the first
startup log.

> The upstream source ships inside the release package, so a fresh install just works.
> Reverse proxy / HTTPS, port hardening, Windows (no Docker) and local development are
> covered in the [deployment guide](deploy/README.md) and
> [development notes](docs/development.md).

---

## Usage

Three steps in daily use: **onboard accounts → hand out keys → point your downstream at
`/v1`**. How each step works, client snippets (OpenAI SDK, cc-switch, …) and the FAQ live
in [the usage guide](docs/usage.md).

Admin API details are available at `/docs` (Swagger UI) when enabled.

## Security

- Keys are shown once and stored as hashes; account credentials never reach the browser
- Inbound IP allow / deny lists (CIDR) plus per-key IP and model allowlists
- Every sensitive action is audited (who, when, what)
- Release packages are signed; one-click updates verify the signature before installing

Threat model and hardening notes: [security notes](docs/security-notes.md) and the
[security audit report](docs/SECURITY-AUDIT.md).

---

## Known limitations

- **No outbound IP pool**: only **inbound** IP control is implemented. Binding a dedicated
  egress IP / proxy per Tencent account would require proxy-pool support in the upstream Go
  service and is out of scope here.
- Request and response **bodies are not stored** — only metadata (model, status, tokens,
  latency, source), to protect privacy.
- Usage is aggregated per day × key × model; hourly granularity would require extending the
  `usage_daily` table.

## Changelog & feedback

- **Changelog**: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) — additions, fixes and changes per version
- **Releases**: [Releases](https://github.com/ithtelab/workbuddy-manager/releases) — each
  version ships a deployable `.tar.gz` / `.zip` (with the built frontend); unpack and run
  `sudo bash deploy/install.sh`
- **Feedback**: [report a bug](https://github.com/ithtelab/workbuddy-manager/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) ·
  [request a feature](https://github.com/ithtelab/workbuddy-manager/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml)

> Please include the version and error logs, and **remove any keys or tokens first**.
> For issues with the upstream workbuddy2api itself, use
> [this repository](https://github.com/ithtelab/workbuddy-manager/issues) — the upstream
> source ships with our releases.

### Release process

Maintainers only need to push a tag:

```bash
git tag v1.0.1 && git push origin v1.0.1
```

CI builds the frontend, packages the artifacts, extracts the matching CHANGELOG section as
release notes, and creates a Release with the archives attached.

  the control plane `/api/*` (accounts, keys, stats, logs, security, settings, users,

  Messages / Models). Handy for Go tooling — `go get` it instead of wiring HTTP and
